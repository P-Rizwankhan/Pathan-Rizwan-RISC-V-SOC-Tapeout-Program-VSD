# ⚡ RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program — VSD  

Welcome to my journey through the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program (VSD)** 🚀  
This repository documents my **week-by-week progress**, showcasing the tasks, milestones, and learnings as I move through the complete SoC design lifecycle.  

The program takes me step by step — **from RTL design → verification → synthesis → GDSII generation → tapeout** — using **open-source tools**.  
It is a part of **India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative** 🇮🇳, with 3,500+ participants contributing to advancing the nation's semiconductor ecosystem.
