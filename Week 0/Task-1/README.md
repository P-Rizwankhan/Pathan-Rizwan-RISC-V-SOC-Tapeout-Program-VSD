# üöÄ Journey into RISC-V SoC Design ‚Äì Task 1

Welcome to my adventure in digital hardware ‚Äì a practical exploration of **System-on-Chip (SoC) creation using RISC-V** as part of India‚Äôs massive collaborative tapeout challenge!  
This documentation records insights and progress from each hands-on milestone, as I build an SoC from initial C code to the brink of chip fabrication.

## üé¨ Task 1: Exploring the SoC Design Pathway

In this section, I walk through the sequential steps behind constructing a working silicon chip, focusing on how algorithms and code translate into real, testable hardware.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Application Code Verification

- Start with a simple C application (e.g., a calculator).
- Compile and validate the code using standard tools (like GCC).  
- This standalone check (output `O0`) guarantees the application logic works before linking it with hardware.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Processor Specification and Functional Modelling

- Convert the intended processor specifications to a C-like executable model.
- Use an architecture-specific compiler (RISC-V GCC, for example) to create a new output (`O1`).
- Match results (`O0` vs `O1`). Success here ‚Äúlocks in‚Äù the intended behavior for future design steps.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Building RTL: Hardware in Code

- Transform the verified spec into **Register Transfer Level (RTL)** logic (usually in Verilog or other hardware description languages).
- This model, still virtual (‚Äúsoft‚Äù hardware), simulates how hardware will behave ‚Äî producing `O2`.
- Match with previous results to ensure functionality is preserved.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ SoC Block Partitioning

- Split the RTL into modular blocks:
  - Processor (synthesizable)
  - Peripherals and custom macros
  - Analog blocks (e.g., ADCs, PLLs)
- Analog IP only needs functional models, not full synthesis.
- Validate the design flow again (`O3`) and ensure all prior outputs match.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Microprocessors vs Microcontrollers

- **Microprocessors:** Just the processing core‚Äîexternal chips needed for I/O and memory.
- **Microcontrollers:** An all-in-one package with the CPU plus necessary support circuits, ideal for embedded platforms.
- This distinction is foundational for both design and interviews.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ From Logic to Layout: Physical Design

- Transition the finalized RTL into real hardware elements (gates, transistors, etc.).
- The design journey continues through:
  - Floorplanning
  - Placement
  - Clock-tree synthesis
  - Routing
- The finished product: a **GDSII layout file**, ready for chip fabrication (‚Äútapeout‚Äù).

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ On-Board Testing and Validation

- Chips are placed onto development boards with required components (memory, interfaces, oscillators).
- The original application code is now run on actual silicon, creating the last output (`O4`).
- All build phases (`O1`, `O2`, `O3`, `O4`) must yield identical results‚Äîfinal proof that the silicon behaves as intended.

## ‚è≥ Timeline & Reflections

- The full process, from design to chip manufacture, usually takes over a year (fabrication alone can exceed four months).
- Example outputs reached up to 130 MHz‚Äîperfect for embedded devices like Arduino alternatives or IoT controls.

---

## üóùÔ∏è Key Definitions

- **Silicon Proven:** The design has been made into a chip and shown to function.
- **Tapeout / Tape-in:** Sending the final GDSII for manufacturing and receiving built chips in return.
- **Synthesizable RTL:** Hardware code that can be directly turned into gates.  
- **Functional RTL:** Used for simulation, not hardware generation.


Heartfelt thanks to the **VSD team**, the vibrant global RISC-V community, and all program collaborators for enabling this innovative learning experience.
